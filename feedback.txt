26. possible but very steep.
27. ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE - tons of corkscrews and bad turns and such
28. set to EASY - 
29. Good
30. tough but easy to jump down to the bottom and land.
31. good
32. very cool but straight up ascent at end that we need to had speed pads lining from the bottom of that straight up ascent to climb = change to hard difficulty
33. good
34. good
35. weird double cork that makes no sense - need change
36. i see an error for shader - fix
37. impossible track - redo complete level - i should not be banked and upside down for that long trying to get to end
38. the end is impossible - curls up weird and banks. redo end
39. impossible climbing corkscrews - redo level COMPLETELY
40. interesting and fun but something is not instanced i am dropping frames
41. fun - need to set diffficulty for all 41-50 as i dont see it in start menu mostly easy medium and hard - no extreme for this circuit
42. another case of frames dropping
43. great level
44. good - different background shader
45. good - different background shader
46. IMPOSSIBLE DO NOT DO THIS IN A LEVEL - START FROM SCRATCH FOR THIS LEVEL
47. easy
48. good idea but the track shader and the background are too similar and that track shader is ugly - fix it to be more vibey and aesthetic and do a different shader for background
49. fails to load - fix it and analyze level and redo if its bad.
50. need some speed pads on the last leg
