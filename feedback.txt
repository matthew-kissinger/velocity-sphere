22 is a complete mess of corkscrews - fix it with a complete redesign with a fun medium level with dig features
24 is definitely hard and borderline impossible with the track flipping upside 
26 - DROPS TONS OF FRAMES NOT SURE WHY - THIS IS A BIG ISSUE
27 - cool idea but again track flips upside down and player is thrown off - if you are doing any loops the player should be looping into the ramp not being thrown off it.
28 - another example of tons of drop in frames maybe instancing is not being used properly in some levels
29 - great
30 - huge drop in frames and impossible level - redo completely learn from your lessons

also the speed powerup is causing the player to get bumped back - it should not have collision - it should just detect collision.

Make sure to think deep and fix these issues.

Circuit 1 and Circuit 2 do not have frame issue but circut 3 levels have different levels with big performance issues - something is not being done right on a fundamental level

Also make sure all the cirucit 3 levels have actual shaders and if they arent real then make them
